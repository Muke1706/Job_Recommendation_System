A **Data Structures & Algorithms based Job Recommendation System** built using **C++**, designed to recommend suitable jobs to users based on **strict CGPA eligibility and skill matching**.

This project focuses on **core software engineering fundamentals**, using efficient data structures to handle **large datasets (500+ users)** and produce **ranked job recommendations**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 👤 User Management
- Loads **500+ users** from `users.csv`
- Each user contains:
  - User ID
  - Name
  - CGPA
  - Domain
  - Skill set

### 💼 Job Management
- Loads **30 job listings** from `jobs.csv`
- Each job includes:
  - Company
  - Role
  - Minimum CGPA
  - Stipend
  - Required skills
- Includes **CGPA = 0 jobs** (internships / open roles) so that every user receives recommendations

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Logic (DSA)

1. **Strict CGPA Filtering**
   - `user.cgpa >= job.minCGPA`
2. **Skill Matching**
   - Each matched skill increases score
3. **Priority-Based Ranking**
   - Uses `priority_queue`
4. **Guaranteed Output**
   - Minimum 5 recommendations per user

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- C++
- STL (unordered_map, unordered_set, priority_queue, vector)
- CSV based storage
